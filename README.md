# Decoding Reader Sentiments: Analysis of Book Reviews

This repository hosts the code and report for the capstone project titled "Decoding Reader Sentiments: A Comprehensive Analysis of Book Reviews". The project leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiments expressed in book reviews and investigates the relationship between sentiments, genres, authors, and feature extraction methods.

## Project Overview

The project delves into three research questions:
1. RQ1: What is the overall sentiment distribution within the dataset?
2. RQ2: Can we identify specific genres or authors that predominantly attract positive or negative sentiments?
3. RQ3: How do different feature extraction techniques—TF-IDF and word embeddings—affect sentiment analysis accuracy?

The analysis is structured as follows:
- **Data Preparation**: Importing libraries, reading the dataset, and initial data exploration.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating the dataset using various statistical and visualization techniques.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizing techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings to prepare the data for modeling.
- **Modeling**: XGBoost classifiers for sentiment classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
- **Conclusion**: Drawing conclusions from the comparative analysis of models and feature extraction methods.

## How to Use

The main analysis can be viewed and executed through the Jupyter Notebook. 
## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle: [Amazon Books Review](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shubham2703/amazon-books-review-eda-sentiment-analysis/notebook).
